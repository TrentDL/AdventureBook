Game Engine Scripting Commit 1

So how the GitHub repositing of multiple diff versions of a app works is 

1. I already have a copy of my project in git, now I want to commit another with new stuff I added.

Well the first let me remind you what my folders are for. 
The School Reposit folder has the cloned repository I created on GitHub web.
What I will do to update it is copy my Unity project folder (I can find it through Unity Hub)
 and paste and logically overwrite the existing one,
 stage the commit again subject description etc. then push again to the web.
